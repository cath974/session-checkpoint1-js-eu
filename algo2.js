/* 
The new guy in your team wrote this terrible code
and now he's asking you why it doesn't work...

He's telling you the specs are:
    - the function receives an array (of integers) or null.
    - the function should return the minimum and maximum values (of the given array)
    - the return value should also be an array, i.e: [min, max]

Example 1:
Array: [4, 6, 35, -65, -9, 0, 67]
Result: [-65, 67]

Example 2:
Array: [-30, 5, 43, 108, -5, -7, 89]
Result: [-30, 108]

Example 3:
Array: [56, 7, 63, 9, 7, 12, 85]
Result: [7, 85]

Fix the following function to help your new coworker!

Note: try changing only the necessary code, don't rewrite the entire thing.

const array = [4, 6, 35, -65, -9, 0, 67];
const array2 = [-30, 5, 43, 108, -5, -7, 89];
const array3 = [56, 7, 63, 9, 7, 12, 85];

const minMax = [];

min = Math.min(...array);
max = Math.max(...array);

minMax.push(min, max)

console.log(minMax)
